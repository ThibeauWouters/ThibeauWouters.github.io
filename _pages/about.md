Welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD candidate at Utrecht University under supervision of Prof. Dr. Chris Van Den Broeck and I am affiliated with Nikhef (Dutch National Institute for Subatomic Physics). My main interests concern Bayesian data analysis tools for gravitational waves, multi-messenger astrophysics and constraints on the nuclear equation of states of neutron stars.


 <!-- I obtained a master of physics and am currently following an advanced master student of artificial intelligence at KU Leuven, Belgium. In September 2023, I am starting a PhD position at Utrecht University under supervision of Chris Van Den Broeck, where I will work on gravitational waves and data analysis to constrain the nuclear equation of state. You can get to know me by browsing through my Portfolio, where I discuss projects I have worked on in the past., or look at my Resources tab, where I try to gather references and useful material on certain topics as well as cheat sheets. -->

This is from the template!

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
