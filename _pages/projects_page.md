Holographic RG flows in gauged supergravity
------

Master thesis of physics studying the applications of AdS/CFT in four-dimensional
supergravity theories. The thesis was performed at the _Institute for Theoretical Physics_ ([ITF](https://fys.kuleuven.be/itf/)) at KU Leuven, under supervision of Nikolay Bobev.

A PDF version of the thesis can be found [here](/files/pdf/master_thesis_physics.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

My presentation of my research can be found [here](/files/pdf/master_thesis_physics_presentation.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
